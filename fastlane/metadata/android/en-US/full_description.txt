<p>Eidetic is an app for improving and testing your working memory. All you need to do is press the buttons in the right order. It's harder than it looks.</p>
<p>
    <b>Background</b><br/>
    The chimp test, also known as the Ayumu memory test, is a test designed to assess working memory.<br/>
    It was popularized by a study conducted at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University in Japan, where chimpanzees demonstrated remarkable short-term memory abilities.<br/>
    Chimps seem to, effectively, have a photographic memory (eidetic memory).
    <br/>
    Untrained humans generally perform significantly worse than chimpanzees on the chimp test. So, this app trains you. The hope is that we can eventually match or beat chimp records.
