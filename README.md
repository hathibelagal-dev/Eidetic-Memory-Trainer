# Eidetic

Eidetic is an app for improving and testing your working memory. All you need to do is press the buttons in the right order.
It's harder than it looks.

## Background

The chimp test, also known as the Ayumu memory test, is a test designed to assess working memory.
It was popularized by a study conducted at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University in Japan, where chimpanzees demonstrated remarkable short-term memory abilities.
Chimps seem to, effectively, have a photographic memory (eidetic memory).

Untrained humans generally perform significantly worse than chimpanzees on the chimp test. So, this app trains you.
The hope is that we can eventually match or beat chimp records.

## Gameplay

- Numbers from 1 to 9 are displayed randomly
- You must memorize the positions of the numbers
- Once you press **1**. all buttons display a **?**
- You need to then use your memory to press **2**, **3**, ... **9**.
- It's game over if you press the wrong button.
